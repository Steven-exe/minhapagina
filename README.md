Hello there!

I'm just testing some stuff, and using things that i learned or that i'am learning =) 

Fell free to explore my code!

If you want to run it:

```
npm install
```
and to start a web server:

```
npm start
```

Now go to your browser and type : http://localhost:5000

I will add more things in the future!
