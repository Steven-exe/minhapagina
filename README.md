Hello There! I'm just testing some stuff and using thing that that i learned or that i am learning =) 

Fell free to explore my code!

If you want to run it:

```
npm install
```

and to start a web server:

```
npm start
```

Now go to your browser and type : http://localhost:5000

I will add more things in the future!
